        <h1>About</h1>
           <p> It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to <b>91% male</b>. If we can empower more females with the confidence in their technological capabilities we can <b>begin to change this landscape.</b></p>
